    /// already fired because the timer period has elapsed, the kernel poller will be woken up
    /// immediately after this call and a notification will be sent. Since this call is a no-op on
    /// kqueue based systems, timer notifications will always be sent on time regardless of calls to
    /// arm. This should not be a problem in practice as timers should be re-armed before the next
    /// timer fires. Otherwise the timer interval is too short to be useful.
    ///
    /// Note that this method isn't strictly necessary for kqueue, but due to the semantics of epoll and

    // indefinitely as ready in the level triggered case, rather than never firing again as in the
    // edge triggered case.
    //
    // Note that if epoll_wait on Linux returned the file descriptors that were ready we wouldn't
    // need to push this call to the user. It's a sad state of affairs on Linux I'm afraid.
