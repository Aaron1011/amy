/// This example show the primary use case for Amy. Registering and handling events is done on a
/// seperate thread from polling for events. This prevents having to wake up the poller to register
/// a new event, as is done with typical event loops. Both epoll and kqueue support operations
/// across threads, so this wakeup strategy is unnecessary. The channel from registrar to poller
/// becomes the kernel instead of a user-space channel. When an event is ready and the poller
/// returns, the event can be sent to a separate thread/thread pool for decoding and state
/// management. When a new registration is required, that thread or another can simply register
/// again.
